For vibration measurements, the most commonly used unit is the acceleration, which is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²) or in g's (the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately 9.81 m/s²). Acceleration is a useful unit for measuring vibration because it provides information about the magnitude of the vibrations and can be related to the forces that the vibration is exerting on the system being monitored.

Another unit that is commonly used in vibration measurements is the vibration velocity, which is measured in meters per second (m/s). Vibration velocity provides information about the speed at which the vibrations are occurring and can be related to the rate of energy transfer from the vibrating source to the system being monitored
